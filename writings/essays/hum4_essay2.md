## Preparation

### Book Summary
The Second Treatise of Government places sovereignty[至高无上的权利] into the hands of the people. Locke's fundamental argument is that people are equal and invested with natural rights in a state of nature in which they live free from outside rule. In the state of nature, natural law governs behavior, and each person has license to execute that law against someone who wrongs them by infringing[违背] on their rights. People take what they need from the earth, but hoard[收集] just enough to cover their needs. Eventually, people begin to trade their excess goods with each other, until they develop a common currency for barter[物物交换], or money. Money eliminates limits on the amount of property they can obtain (unlike food, money does not spoil), and they begin to gather estates[地产] around themselves and their families.

People then exchange some of their natural rights to enter into society with other people, and be protected by common laws and a common executive power to enforce the laws. People need executive power to protect their property and defend their liberty. The civil state is beholden to the people, and has power over the people only insofar as it exists to protect and preserve their welfare. Locke describes a state with a separate judicial, legislative, and executive branch--the legislative branch being the most important of the three, since it determines the laws that govern civil society.

People have the right to dissolve their government, if that government ceases to work solely in their best interest. The government has no sovereignty of its own--it exists to serve the people.

To sum up, Locke's model consists of a civil state, built upon the natural rights common to a people who need and welcome an executive power to protect their property and liberties; the government exists for the people's benefit and can be replaced or overthrown if it ceases to function toward that primary end.

### Related to the prompt
In John Locke's justification of political authority, he makes both empirical and religious assumptions. Empirical assumptions refer to observations and facts that are based on experience or evidence, while religious assumptions refer to beliefs that are based on faith or divine revelation.

The empirical assumptions in Locke's justification of political authority include the idea that individuals have natural rights, such as the right to life, liberty, and property, and that government exists to protect these rights. He also assumes that individuals have the capacity for reason and that they are capable of making decisions about how they are governed.

Locke's religious assumptions include the idea that God has given individuals the right to govern themselves and that government should be based on natural law, which is derived from divine revelation. He also assumes that God has created humans with the capacity for reason and that individuals have a duty to obey God's laws.

In terms of which assumptions are crucial, both the empirical and religious assumptions play a significant role in Locke's justification of political authority. The empirical assumptions provide the foundation for his ideas about the role of government in protecting individual rights, while the religious assumptions provide the basis for his ideas about the morality and legitimacy of government. Ultimately, both sets of assumptions are necessary for his overall argument about political authority.

John Locke's political philosophy is grounded in religious assumptions that are rooted in Christianity. Some of the key religious assumptions in his work include:

- The belief in a higher power: In his work, Locke refers to a "Creator" who is the source of all things and who has established the laws of nature.

- The idea that morality and justice are rooted in divine law: Locke believed that the laws of nature are derived from divine law and that individuals have a duty to follow them. He also believed that the purpose of government is to enforce these laws and to protect the rights of individuals.

- The belief in natural rights: Locke believed that individuals have natural rights, such as the right to life, liberty, and property, that are granted by God and protected by the laws of nature.

### Structure
The structure of the essay could be as follows:

Introduction: Provide a brief overview of John Locke's political philosophy, highlighting his ideas on the justification of political authority and the role of empirical and religious assumptions in his work.

Overview of Empirical Assumption: Discuss Locke's views on the importance of experience, observation, and evidence in shaping human knowledge. Detail the central features of his empirical assumption, including the idea that people have natural rights and that political authority arises from a social contract.

Overview of Religious Assumption: Discuss Locke's views on the role of religion in shaping political authority. Detail the central features of his religious assumption, including the idea that the law of nature is a product of divine revelation and that political authority is subject to divine judgment.

Empirical Assumption and Natural Rights: Argue that the empirical assumption is central to Locke's justification of political authority because it underlies his ideas on natural rights. Discuss the ways in which experience, observation, and evidence are used to support the idea that all people have the right to life, liberty, and property.

Religious Assumption and Divine Revelation: Argue that the religious assumption is less important than the empirical one in the justification of political authority because it relies on the idea of divine revelation. Discuss the ways in which this idea can be challenged, and how this challenges the validity of political authority based on religious assumptions.

Empirical Assumption and Social Contract: Argue that the empirical assumption is more important than the religious one in the justification of political authority because it provides a basis for the social contract. Discuss the ways in which the social contract is based on a mutual agreement between the people and the government, and how this agreement is shaped by the empirical assumption.

Conclusion: Sum up the main arguments of the essay and provide a final conclusion on why the empirical assumption is more important than the religious one in the justification of political authority.

### Quotes: Religion
- [6] But though this be a state of liberty, yet it is not a state of licence: though man in that state have an uncontroulable liberty to dispose of his person or possessions, yet he has not liberty to destroy himself, or so much as any creature in his possession, but where some nobler use than its bare preservation calls for it. **The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions**: for men being all the workmanship of one omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker; all the servants of one sovereign master, sent into the world by his order, and about his business; they are his property, whose workmanship they are, made to last during his, not one another's pleasure: and being furnished with like faculties, sharing all in one community of nature, there cannot be supposed any such subordination among us, that may authorize us to destroy one another, as if we were made for one another's uses, as the inferior ranks of creatures are for our's. Every one, as he is bound to preserve himself, and not to quit his station wilfully, so by the like reason, when his own preservation comes not in competition, ought he, as much as he can, to preserve the rest of mankind, and may not, unless it be to do justice on an offender, take away, or impair the life, or what tends to the preservation of the life, the liberty, health, limb, or goods of another.
  > 虽然这是自由的状态，却不是放任的状态。在这状态中，虽然人具有处理他的人身或财产的无限自由，但是他并没有毁灭自身或他所占有的任何生物的自由，除非有一种比单纯地保存它来得更高贵的用处要求将它毁灭。自然状态有一种为人人所应遵守的自然法对它起着支配作用；而理性，也就是自然法，教导着有意遵从理性的全人类：人们既然都是平等和独立的，任何人就不得侵害他人的生命、健康、自由或财产。因为既然人们都是全能和无限智慧的创世主的创造物，既然都是唯一的最高主宰的仆人，奉他的命令来到这个世界，从事于他的事务，他们就是他的财产，是他的创造物，他要他们存在多久就存在多久，而不由他们彼此之间作主；我们既赋有同样的能力，在同一自然社会内共享一切，就不能设想我们之间有任何从属关系，可使我们有权彼此毁灭，好像我们生来是为彼此利用的，如同低等动物生来是供我们利用一样。正因为每一个人必须保存自己，不能擅自改变他的地位，所以基于同样理由，当他保存自身不成问题时，他就应该尽其所能保存其余的人类，而除非为了惩罚一个罪犯，不应该夺去或损害另一个人的生命以及一切有助于保存另一个人的生命、自由、健康、肢体或物品的事物。

- [22] THE natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of nature for his rule.
    > 人的自然自由，就是不受人间任何上级权力的约束，不处在人们的意志或立法权之下，只以自然法作为他的准绳。

- [34]上帝将世界给予人类所共有；但是，既然他将它给予人类是为了他们的利益，为了使他们尽可能从它获得生活的最大便利，就不能假设上帝的意图是要使世界永远归公共所有而不加以耕植。
- [32]上帝和人的理性指示他垦殖土地，这就是说，为了生活需要而改良土地，从而把属于他的东西、即劳动施加于土地之上。谁服从了上帝的命令对土地的任何部分加以开拓、耕耘和播种，他就在上面增加了原来属于他所有的某种东西，这种所有物是旁人无权要求的，如果加以夺取，就不能不造成损害。
- [35]所以上帝命令人开拓土地，从而给人在这范围内将土地拨归私用的权力

  - Use Times New Roman 12pt.
- Double-space everything except longer, indented quotations (see Quotations).
- Title
  - Do not include a separate title page. Put the title and your name at the top of the first page. No other information (PID, section, etc.) is necessary. Then skip four lines (two double-spaced lines) and start your essay.
- No Secondary Sources
  - Do not include a Works Cited page. In Humanities, only use the assigned materials.
- Referring to Works. 
  - Italicize the titles of long works (including novels, plays, books of history or philosophy, and long poems) and put quotation marks around the titles of short works (essays, short stories, articles, and short poems).
- Indent Paragraphs. 
  - Indent all paragraphs five spaces (1 standard tab). Do not add space between paragraphs.
- Humanities reserves the right to refuse to accept or to penalize improperly formatted papers.

### Citation
- Format the first citation of a text as follows: (Author's last name, Title, Location) 
  > Ex1. (Shakespeare, *The Tempest*, V, 1.205-213)

  > Ex2. (Montaigne, "On Cannibals," p. 86-87)

- Abbreviate citations after the first by using either the author's last name or the title (shortened if it is long) and the location in the text.
  > Ex1. (Shakespeare, I, 2.351) or (*Tempest*, I, 2.351)

  >Ex2. (Montaigne, p. 88) or ("Cannibals," p. 88)

  Exception: If your sentence includes the author's name or the title of the text you are quoting, then you can leave that information out of the citation.

- **Titles**. Italicize[斜体] the title of long works. Use quotation marks for shorter works.

  Exception. Religious scriptures are neither italicized nor placed in quotation marks. This is the case for the titles of the complete work (Bible, Quran, and Bhagavad Gita, etc.) as well as the books within the work (Genesis, Jonah, and 1 Corinthians, etc.).

- **Location**. Should you use the page number or some other means of locating the quotation you use? The rule is to use the most universal location reference available to you. For many texts, the page number to the edition you are using is the best available option. There are some common exceptions:

- **The Bible**, or similarly formatted scriptures. Use the chapter and verse, separated by either a colon or a period.
    > Ex. (Job 1:1) or (1 Corinthians 13.4-7)
- **Poetry** is referenced by line number.
    > Ex. (Eliot, "The Waste Land," 433) & (Heaney, "Follower,” 4-6)
- **Epic Poetry**. Include the book in addition to the line number.
    > Ex. (Homer, *Odyssey*, 24.284) or (Milton, *Paradise Lost*, IV.51-57)
- **Theatre**. When citing a play, the method depends on the format. When available, use the act and scene, and if in verse, the line number.
    >Ex. (Sophocles, *Antigone*, 684-685) & (Shakespeare, *Hamlet*, III, 1.56-60)
### Prose Quotation


- Shorter, embedded quotations
    - The citation goes outside the enclosing quotation mark and before the period.
    - Use a comma or colon to set a quotation off from the rest of the sentence if it is an independent clause.
        >Ex. Machiavelli argues of a prince, "he must learn from the fox and the lion; because the lion is defenseless against traps and a fox is defenseless against wolves" (The Prince, p. 56).
    - Do not use a comma before the quotation when it is grammatically integrated into your sentence.
        >Job is described as "blameless and upright, one who feared God, and turned away from evil" (Job 1.1).

- Longer, indented quotations (block quotations)
    - Longer quotations should be single-spaced and indented. A good definition of long is more than three lines of poetry or four lines of prose.
    - Indent 10 spaces (2 standard tabs).
    - Since the indentation represents a break in your prose, the passage should be set off with a colon.
    - Do not surround the passage with quotation marks. Indenting takes their place.
    - Place the citation on the line below the quoted passage, outside the ending punctuation, and toward the right margin.

    > Ex1. During his trial, recognizing that the jury will not understand or appreciate his reasons for acting the way he does, Socrates states:

    > [I]If I say that it is the greatest good for a man to discuss virtue every day as well as those other things you hear me conversing about and testing myself and others because the unexamined life is not worth living for men, you will believe me even less.(Plato, Apology 38a)

## Thesis Statement
The success of your argument depends on your thesis. A thesis is the central claim that you will argue for in your essay. In a short essay, the thesis should be presented in the first paragraph.

An effective thesis guides the argument. The thesis makes a claim for which you present evidence to persuade the reader that the claim is right. A strong, clear, and precise thesis leads to a strongly argued essay, while a weak or overly general thesis leads to an essay without clear focus.

### Components of a Thesis
There are many ways to explain what makes a thesis complete. How you divide the parts is less important than making sure your thesis articulates an argument that shapes and guides your essay. The following three components are one way to think about a complete thesis:
- **Position**. Does your thesis take a clear position on the question the prompt is asking? This requires more than sharing a topic with the prompt. Are you responding directly to the issues and the specific question it asks?
- **Claim**. The heart of the thesis describes what specific elements of the text you will be using to make your argument. The claim is more than a recitation of the facts from the text (that would be a summary). The claim should connect many of the text's facts together. What patterns do you see in the text?
- **Claim Clarification**. A complete thesis shows why the claim you made is reasonable. How do we know the connection you identified is meaningful? Does your claim connect it to any of the themes or values of the text as a whole? These connections can make for stronger claims.


Let's work through an example:
>Sample Prompt. Achilles is reputed to be the greatest hero in the Trojan War, but his behavior in the Iliad suggests he has become disenchanted by war. Does Achilles' behavior undermine the heroic ethic?

- **Position**. There are two basic positions available to you in response to the prompt. Yes, Achilles undermines the heroic ethic. Or no, he does not. Your thesis does not need to argue that everything Achilles does undermines the heroic ethic (or does not), but your thesis should clearly work from one side or the other and avoid ambivalence like "sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't." When taking a position, ask yourself a question like: On the whole, do Achilles' actions undermine the heroic ethic? Let's assume you decide yes.
- **Claim**. There are many possibilities here. The essay will be about Achilles and the heroic ethic. The claim should connect the two through the specifics you will discuss.

    > Ex. By refusing to listen to Greek leadership and his friends, Achilles undermines the heroic ethic.
- **Claim Clarification**. Make your claim more substantial. What does refusing to listen say about Achilles? About the heroic ethic in Homer's epics? The goal is to show why the refusal to listen undermines the heroic ethic.
    >Ex. By refusing to listen to Greek leadership and his friends, Achilles undermines the heroic ethic. By not listening, he rejects the relationships of trust that sustain the heroic system.

How the Argument Proceeds. The reader will expect that this essay will discuss examples that will show that the heroic ethic is based on trust and that when Achilles refuses to listen to others it is because he no longer trusts them.

### Guidelines for Writing an Effective Thesis
- **Specificity**. An effective thesis does more than describe the general topic; it makes a specific argument.

    > Poor thesis. This essay considers Achilles and the heroic ethic.

    "This essay considers" signals the introduction of a topical discussion or statement of procedure, not an argument. It is an unnecessary, indirect statement. Get directly into the substance of the argument.

    > Improved but incomplete thesis. Achilles' behavior consistently undermines the heroic ethic.

    There is an argumentative claim here, but it lacks the specifics necessary to show how and why Achilles undermines the ethic.

    > Complete thesis. By refusing to listen to Greek leadership and his friends,Achilles undermines the heroic ethic. By not listening, he rejects the relationships of trust that sustain the heroic system.

    The argumentative claim from the previous version remains, but it is now filled out with specifics: listening to others and trust relationships. It narrows the subject and focuses the argument in a way that the reader can understand.



### Qualities of an effective thesis
- **The heart, not just the start**. Your thesis should articulate the argument you will defend. It is not a springboard for talking generally about some subject.
- **Concise**. The thesis should be identifiable in the introduction, and it should be as concise as possible. Sometimes it takes more than one sentence to state your argument clearly. That is okay. If it takes more than two sentences in a short essay, that is a sign that your argument lacks sufficient focus.
- **Precise**. Precision comes from including specific information and being clear about the relationship between the different parts of the thesis.
- **Worth arguing**. An argument worth having is one in which reasonable people might reach different conclusions. You are arguing because you have to persuade the reader to adopt your view of the issue. Avoid arguments that are obvious.
    > Ex. Achilles is the greatest hero in Greece.
    Homer tells us often that this is the case; it is undeniable if you have read the Iliad. Test your argument. Ask yourself, "So what?" Is your argument showing the reader something interesting about the text you are discussing?
- **Unified argument**. Your thesis should present a unified argument. The split thesis and list thesis are two common forms that arguments without unity take.
    - Split theses occur if you compare apples and oranges. Yes, they are both fruit, but do they have anything substantive worth comparing?
        > Ex. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus thinks piety is helping the poor and sick, and in the Aeneid, Aeneas thinks piety is listening to the gods.

        This essay will argue about piety in the two texts, but the thesis provides no specific terms of comparison between Jesus and Aeneas. The essay will be two mini-essays: one on Jesus and piety, and another on Aeneas and piety. Your challenge is to figure out how to talk about the two of them together throughout the essay.
    - List theses occur if you allow the themes or main points of discussion in your essay to stand-in for the explanation. A list of things does not add up to an explanation.
        > Ex. Abraham deserves God's favor because he obeyed when God called him, governed his family well, and did not commit any major offences against God.
        
        It is possible to see how these three claims about Abraham might be related to his deserving God's favor, but alone, they do not show why he deserves it. The thesis must push deeper and articulate something that unites these three claims. Are these three claims a subset of a principle or value that makes Abraham special?

### Introduction

In a short essay, the thesis should appear in the first paragraph. Its placement in the paragraph depends on style and audience. The introduction should be concise. If it stretches over a page, something has gone wrong. In Humanities, assume that your reader is already familiar with the assignment, the texts, and the lectures. This shared familiarity means you do not need to restate the entire prompt, to give historical and biographical information about the texts, or to convince the reader that the topic itself is valuable. You can get directly to the matter at hand and begin presenting the information necessary for understanding your thesis.
- Avoid the over-general first sentence. It can be difficult to start an essay. One common shortcut to avoid is the grandiose statement about the universe, humanity, or history. These claims are uninteresting if true, and more often than not, they are questionable opinions masked as universal truths.
    > Ex. Since the beginning of time, humans have wanted to honor the gods.

    Have they really? Is this essay about archaeological discoveries in the oldest known cultural sites? If not, then start with the specific context of your essay.
- Guide the reader. Writers often wonder where the thesis statement should go in the introduction. Should there be anything before or after the thesis
statement? The purpose of the introduction is to guide the reader, so that by the end of the paragraph, he or she knows what your subject is and what you are arguing about it. To determine what goes in the introduction, ask yourself, "Is there any further guidance the reader needs, either before or after the thesis?" If so, put it in. Perhaps there is a term in your thesis that needs to be defined, or perhaps your reader needs a sense of how the paper will proceed. This "roadmap" should not be long or detailed, but it should signal to the reader what the main points of discussion will be. Here is an example:


    > Homer's political ideas are based in a natural hierarchy, which is very different from the universal equality valued by modern democracies. I will show Homer's reliance on hierarchy and rejection of equality are evident in his pictures of good leadership, his accounts of social cooperation, and his dislike of democracy, by which I mean the direct of rule of a people as a whole.
    
    Let's break that down:
    - Thesis: Homer's political ideas are based in a natural hierarchy, which is opposed to the universal equality valued by modern democracies.
    - Roadmap: I will show Homer's reliance on hierarchy and rejection of universal equality are evident in his pictures of good leadership, his accounts of social cooperation, and his dislike of democracy
    - Definition: by which I mean the direct of rule of a people as a whole.
    - 
The introduction should not include information just to make it "fuller." Consider what is necessary to introduce your argument and put it in the proper context. Nothing more is necessary. In some cases, the introduction might only consist of the thesis statement.
